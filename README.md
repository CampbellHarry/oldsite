## Features

- Cool Animations
- Fast Page Changing
- Multi-Device functionality

## Optimizations

I have split my site up into lots of different sections for ease of use and for the site optimization if it was all one page it would take up substantial resources. I have also changed up the animations to be simple but effective to ease off strain on system resources.
